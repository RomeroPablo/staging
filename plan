You can compile for windows on Visual Studio
You can compile for linux on linux

That's it

At this point, this is where the project is at

Next: Networking with ASIO, locally first

Next: let's figure out how we would add the CANDBC stuff

Next: Data Visaulization, maybe using the vis. libraries we talked about

NOTES:

Be very verbose, clear, and focused,
Make sure that what you are doing is clear in your mind
Describe exactly what you want

Do not let distractions into your mind today, this will ruin you

We are in combat, this is what it takes to win

Breathe 1 2
